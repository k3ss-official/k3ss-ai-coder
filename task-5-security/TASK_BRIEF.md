# TASK 5: Security & Enterprise Features

## 🎯 Your Mission
Build the **enterprise-grade security foundation** that makes the Ultimate AI Code Assistant safe for production deployment while maintaining powerful capabilities. This is the security backbone that enables enterprise adoption.

## 🚀 What You're Building
The **security fortress** that protects everything:
- Zero-trust security architecture with defense-in-depth
- Enterprise authentication and authorization systems
- Data protection and privacy controls (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 compliant)
- Comprehensive audit and compliance framework
- Threat detection and incident response system

## 📋 Specific Deliverables

### 1. Zero-Trust Security Architecture (`/security/`)
```typescript
interface SecurityFramework {
  authenticateUser(credentials: Credentials): Promise<AuthResult>;
  authorizeAction(user: User, action: Action, resource: Resource): Promise<boolean>;
  encryptData(data: any, context: SecurityContext): Promise<EncryptedData>;
  auditLog(event: SecurityEvent): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Enterprise Authentication (`/auth/`)
- **Multi-provider SSO** - SAML, OAuth2, OIDC, Active Directory
- **Multi-factor authentication** - TOTP, hardware keys, biometric
- **Session management** - Secure token handling and rotation
- **Role-based access control** - Granular permissions and policies

### 3. Data Protection System (`/data-protection/`)
```typescript
class DataProtectionManager {
  classifyData(data: any): DataClassification;
  applyProtection(data: any, classification: DataClassification): ProtectedData;
  enforceRetention(data: any, policy: RetentionPolicy): Promise<void>;
  anonymizeData(data: any, level: AnonymizationLevel): AnonymizedData;
}
```

### 4. Compliance Framework (`/compliance/`)
- **GDPR compliance** - Data subject rights, consent management, breach notification
- **CCPA compliance** - Consumer privacy rights and data handling
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Security, availability, processing integrity controls
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management system

### 5. Threat Detection & Response (`/threat-detection/`)
- **Anomaly detection** - ML-based behavior analysis
- **Intrusion detection** - Real-time threat monitoring
- **Incident response** - Automated response workflows
- **Forensic capabilities** - Detailed investigation tools

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Go** for high-performance security services
- **TypeScript** for web security components
- **PostgreSQL** for secure audit logging
- **Redis** for session management and caching
- **Docker** for secure sandboxing

### Integration Points
- **All Tasks**: Provides security services to every component
- **Task 1**: Secure credential storage and UI security
- **Task 2**: Secure AI model execution and API protection
- **Task 3**: CLI authentication and secure command execution
- **Task 4**: Secure browser automation and web access controls

### Security Standards
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Key Management**: Hardware security modules (HSM) support
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege, zero-trust model
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs with cryptographic integrity

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero-trust architecture passing independent security assessment
- [ ] Enterprise SSO integration with major identity providers
- [ ] Full GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 compliance
- [ ] Threat detection with <5 minute response time
- [ ] 99.99% uptime for security services
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail for all system operations

## 🔗 Integration Notes
- Provide security APIs for all other tasks to consume
- Implement secure communication channels between all components
- Coordinate credential management across VSCode, CLI, and web components
- Ensure all AI model interactions are logged and monitored

## ⚡ Vibe Coder Speed
**Target: 3 days to enterprise-ready security**
- Day 1: Core security architecture + authentication + encryption
- Day 2: Authorization + audit logging + compliance framework
- Day 3: Threat detection + incident response + integration testing

## 💡 Enterprise Security Features

### Advanced Authentication
```typescript
// Multi-factor authentication flow
const auth = await securityManager.authenticate({
  primary: { type: "saml", provider: "okta" },
  secondary: { type: "totp", device: "authenticator" },
  context: { ip: "10.0.1.100", device: "trusted" }
});
```

### Data Classification & Protection
```typescript
// Automatic data protection
const protectedCode = await dataProtection.protect({
  content: sourceCode,
  classification: "confidential",
  policy: "enterprise-standard",
  encryption: "aes-256-gcm"
});
```

### Compliance Automation
```typescript
// GDPR compliance automation
await compliance.handleDataSubjectRequest({
  type: "data-export",
  subject: "user@company.com",
  scope: "all-personal-data",
  format: "machine-readable"
});
```

### Threat Detection
```typescript
// Real-time threat monitoring
const threat = await threatDetection.analyze({
  event: "unusual-api-access",
  context: { user, time, location, pattern },
  severity: "high",
  autoRespond: true
});
```

## 🛡️ Security Architecture Principles

### Defense in Depth
1. **Perimeter Security** - Network-level protection and access controls
2. **Application Security** - Input validation, output encoding, secure coding
3. **Data Security** - Encryption, classification, access controls
4. **Identity Security** - Strong authentication, authorization, session management
5. **Infrastructure Security** - Secure deployment, monitoring, incident response

### Zero-Trust Implementation
- **Never Trust, Always Verify** - Every request authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access** - Minimal permissions for each operation
- **Assume Breach** - Continuous monitoring and rapid response
- **Verify Explicitly** - Context-aware access decisions

### Privacy by Design
- **Data Minimization** - Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation** - Use data only for stated purposes
- **Storage Limitation** - Retain data only as long as necessary
- **Transparency** - Clear privacy policies and user controls
