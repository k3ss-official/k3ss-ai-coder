# K3SS AI Coder - Ultimate AI Code Assistant

🚀 **The Ultimate AI Code Assistant** - Combining the best of Plandex, Cline, Cursor, and Windsurf with revolutionary new capabilities.

## Project Overview

This is the **first and only** AI code assistant that provides:
- ✅ **Local Model Support** (Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio, HF Transformers)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Browser Control** (Full web automation)
- ✅ **Integrated Web Search** (Built-in research capabilities)
- ✅ **Security-First Design** (Enterprise-grade from ground up)
- ✅ **Unified Experience** (VSCode extension + CLI)

## Development Structure

### 🎯 Vibe Coder Speed: MVP-in-Three with Low2No

This project is built using **5 concurrent Manus tasks** for maximum velocity:

```
📁 k3ss-ai-coder/
├── 📁 task-1-vscode-ui/          # VSCode Extension & UI Framework
├── 📁 task-2-ai-orchestration/   # AI Models & Integration Engine  
├── 📁 task-3-cli-automation/     # CLI & Automation Framework
├── 📁 task-4-browser-web/        # Browser Control & Web Research
├── 📁 task-5-security/           # Security & Enterprise Features
├── 📁 mvp/                       # Final assembled MVP
├── 📁 docs/                      # Documentation & Research
└── 📁 shared/                    # Shared utilities & configs
```

## Task Execution Flow

1. **Task 1 (Operator)**: Creates repo structure and coordinates integration
2. **Tasks 2-5**: Execute in parallel, each building their component
3. **Task 1**: Assembles all components into working MVP
4. **Result**: Production-ready Ultimate AI Code Assistant

## Quick Start

Each Manus task should:
1. Navigate to their designated task directory
2. Read the `TASK_BRIEF.md` file
3. Execute their specific component
4. Deliver working code to their directory

## Architecture Highlights

- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Seamless local/cloud model routing
- **Flow State Optimization**: Non-intrusive AI assistance
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Enterprise compliance built-in
- **2M+ Token Context**: Advanced project understanding
- **Cumulative Diff Sandbox**: Safe code modification
