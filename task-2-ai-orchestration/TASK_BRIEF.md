# TASK 2: AI Orchestration & Model Integration Engine

## 🎯 Your Mission
Build the **intelligent core** of the Ultimate AI Code Assistant - the sophisticated AI orchestration system that manages multiple AI models and provides seamless local/cloud integration.

## 🚀 What You're Building
The **AI brain** that makes this tool revolutionary:
- Multi-provider AI model integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- **FIRST-EVER** comprehensive local model support (Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio, HF Transformers)
- Intelligent model routing and selection
- Advanced context management (2M+ tokens)
- Response processing and quality assurance

## 📋 Specific Deliverables

### 1. Multi-Provider AI Integration (`/providers/`)
```typescript
// Unified interface for all AI providers
interface AIProvider {
  name: string;
  models: AIModel[];
  sendRequest(prompt: string, context: Context): Promise<AIResponse>;
  getCapabilities(): ProviderCapabilities;
}
```

### 2. Local Model Support (`/local-models/`)
- **Ollama integration** - Full API wrapper and model management
- **llama.cpp integration** - Direct binary execution and optimization
- **LM Studio integration** - API client and model sync
- **Hugging Face Transformers** - Python bridge and model loading

### 3. Intelligent Model Router (`/router/`)
```typescript
class ModelRouter {
  selectOptimalModel(task: TaskType, context: Context, constraints: Constraints): AIModel;
  routeRequest(request: AIRequest): Promise<AIResponse>;
  handleFallbacks(failedModel: AIModel, request: AIRequest): Promise<AIResponse>;
}
```

### 4. Context Management System (`/context/`)
- Project mapping and file relationship analysis
- Intelligent context selection and relevance scoring
- Context compression and optimization
- 2M+ token context window management

### 5. Response Processing (`/processing/`)
- Response validation and quality scoring
- Code syntax validation and formatting
- Error detection and correction suggestions
- Response caching and optimization

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript/Node.js** for main orchestration
- **Python** for local model integration (HF Transformers)
- **Go** for performance-critical components (inspired by Plandex)
- **WebSocket** for real-time communication

### Integration Points
- **Task 1**: Provides UI interfaces for model selection and status
- **Task 3**: Shares AI capabilities through CLI commands
- **Task 4**: Powers intelligent web content analysis
- **Task 5**: Implements secure model execution and API management

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: <1s for simple queries, <5s for complex analysis
- **Context Processing**: Handle 100,000+ file projects
- **Model Switching**: <500ms between local/cloud models
- **Memory Usage**: <2GB for local model execution

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Support for 5+ cloud AI providers
- [ ] Working local model integration for all 4 frameworks
- [ ] Intelligent model routing with 95%+ accuracy
- [ ] Context management handling large projects (100k+ files)
- [ ] Sub-second response times for common operations
- [ ] Comprehensive API for other tasks to consume

## 🔗 Integration Notes
- Export clean APIs for Task 1 (VSCode) and Task 3 (CLI)
- Provide WebSocket interface for real-time communication
- Implement secure credential management (coordinate with Task 5)
- Support browser automation AI analysis (coordinate with Task 4)

## ⚡ Vibe Coder Speed
**Target: 3 days to working AI orchestration system**
- Day 1: Core architecture + cloud provider integration
- Day 2: Local model support + intelligent routing
- Day 3: Context management + optimization + testing
